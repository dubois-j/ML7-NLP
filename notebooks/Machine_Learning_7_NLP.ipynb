    "Today we are going to tackle the sentiment analysis problem, a *text classification* problem. The idea is pretty simple : we want to automatically predict whether a text expresses positive or negative sentiments. To do so we will use the IMDB dataset, that contains 50000 movie reviews from the www.imdb.com website, and their corresponding sentiment : positive or negative. It is thus a binary classification problem, where we want to predict a binary target $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$. We will go through different ways of encoding a text in a vectorial form $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, as well as different classification models, from classic ways to modern deep learning models."

      "I saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in Canada (still only in limited release). It was worth the wait and then some. I am a very avid reader of Margaret Laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film. I actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel. I liked that the character of Bram Shipley was a bit less harsh, and that there seemed to be more of a love story between Hagar and Bram, which made the scenes at the end of Bram's life that much more moving. The loss seemed stronger. Hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. She WAS Hagar through and through. Christine Horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead I am sure. Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I could go on and on, overall a 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and can't wait for it to come out on DVD, a must own for my collection!\n"

    "Now we have cleaned the reviews of our dataset, how do we represent them as vectors in order to classify it ? \n",
    "One classic way to achieve that is the Bag-Of-Words (BOW) approach. To encode a text in a bag of word, we first need to know all the different words $w$ that appear in all our reviews, called the vocabulary : $w \\in \\mathcal{V}$. For each word $w$ we attribute an index $idx(w) = i$ with $i \\in \\{0, |\\mathcal{V}|-1\\}$, and represent a review $r$ as a vector of the size of the vocabulary $x_r \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{V}|}$. To encode a review we are simply going to count how many time each word appears and assign it at its corresponding index in the bag-of-words vector : $x_{r,i} = count(w,r)$, where i = idx(w). \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we completely disregard the words order, and simply take into account the number of times each word appears in each review to represent them. There are many variations of this concept, TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) for example, gives more weight to uncommon words. Read more about BOW and TF-IDF there:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/02/quick-introduction-bag-of-words-bow-tf-idf/\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with bag-of-words. In general we don't consider the whole vocabulary but only some of the most frequent words in order to reduce the dimensionality and avoid noise from rare words. Here we will only consider the 10000 most frequent words of the training set, meaning the words that are only in the test set will be ignored. Thus we have : $x_r \\in \\mathbb{R^{10000}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encode all the reviews as bag-of-words, and train and evaluate a logistic regression model on the following train test splits. As we have seen previously, if we wanted to investigate this model we should also grid search for hyperparameters by doing a cross-validation with validation sets, etc. However this is not the goal today, so we'll simply go for a train/test split for this experiment. Concerning the evaluation metrics, in this case we care equally about correctly predicting the positives and the negatives, and we have a balanced dataset, thus we can simply use accuracy this time.\n",
